**Evp3** is a Unity project that was used in a demonstration at Unite Shanghai
2019. It was presented in the beginning of [my talk] with a Chinese traditional
instrument ([pipa]) player. In the demonstration, a [RealSense] depth camera
was used to capture the appearance and the motion of the player. It's
visualized using [Visual Effect Graph] in the same manner as [Rsvfx].

Evp3 was made with Unity 2019.1. A RealSense depth camera device (D415 is
preferable) and an audio input device (mic) are required.
